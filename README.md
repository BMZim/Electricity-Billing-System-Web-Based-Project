# Electricity-Billing-System-Web-Based-Project

I have upload all of the project files.


Here is the installation Process:

Steps:
1. Downloads All the files.
2. Extract the Zip.
3. After Unzipping copy the folder and paste it in This PC/Local Disk C/Xampp/htdocs:
   Most of the cases this is the universal path:  This PC/Local Disk C/Xampp/htdocs.
   if you didn't find xampp in this path then find where your xampp is installed.
4. Then paste the folder there.
5. Also you will find ebss.sql file in folder.
6. You have to just import that file into xampp admin panel like: Start Xampp then type in your browser localhost/phpmyadmin.
7. Then go to import section select a database and import ebss.sql file.
8. All done you are ready to run the project.
